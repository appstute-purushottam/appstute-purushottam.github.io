Love is simply a quality. If the person you love is not in your physical presence, you are still capable of loving them. 
If the people you love cease to exist, you still continue to love them.
This means you are using people around you as mere stimuli to find expression for this innate quality. 
Love is not about what you do. Love is the way you are.
